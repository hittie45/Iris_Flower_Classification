Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning
Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify Iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their sepal and petal attributes. The goal is to develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of accurately predicting the species of Iris flowers given their measurements.

Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each containing four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is evenly distributed among the three classes, with 50 samples per class. It serves as a benchmark dataset for classification tasks and is widely used in machine learning research and education.

Features
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling to ensure optimal performance of machine learning models.
Model Selection: Various classification algorithms are explored, including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN).
Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure robustness of results.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms are tuned using techniques such as grid search or random search to optimize model performance.
Visualization: Visualization techniques such as scatter plots, confusion matrices, and decision boundaries are employed to analyze the results and gain insights into the classification process.
